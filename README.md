│   └── out
│       └── CreateOrderAdapter.java
├── application

## How to use

---

It’s very simple to create classes of hexagonal-architecture.

There’s just 2 steps for this plugin.

1. Choose your programming language.(**Java / Kotlin**)
2. Enter your common prefix of classes.
   (Ex : If you enter `createOrder`, the tree structure shown above will be generated.)

ps. It was developed for personal purposes, so customization is not possible.
